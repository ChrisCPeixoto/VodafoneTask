# Vodafone Homework
# To start:
npm install
npm start


# Notes:
  - The name were used as an id on the mapping of the contacts array only for the purpose of this example with a small data set. In a real life case, an id should be included to each contact. And it should be used as the key and also to search on the array.
  - On the edit I used placeholder. To give the props values to the values of the input, we would need the functions to handle the changing of the states


# Possibles improvements:
  - Have a "All" on the list of letters, to "reset" the search by letter.
  - Limited the amount of card on the screen to 9, and then have the user drag to next 9, with a Carrousel
